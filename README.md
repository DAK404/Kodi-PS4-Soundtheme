# PlayStation 4 Sound theme for Kodi

## Update: **Seems like [KnuxBoy04](https://github.com/KnuxBoy04) on GitHub is trying to revive the PS4 theme.** Please see: https://github.com/KnuxBoy04/skin.orbis

This theme was originally made by Toyota12303. Subsequently, the download links for the theme and sound theme hosted by Toyota12303 (hosted on Google Drive) was invalid.

Later on, another user (SZNX) on the Kodi Forums uploaded a copy of the sound theme, but it didn't seem to work properly.

Delving into the XML file (sounds.xml), there were a few issues, causing the theme to not work. (It would work fine on Windows since windows does not care about case sensitivity of file names)

I have corrected issues in the XML regarding the filenames and fixed the indentation to make it more readable. Tested it successfully on Kodi 21.1 (Omega)

## Installation Instructions

* Download this repository and zip the `resource.uisounds.PlayStation` directory
  * The directory must be zipped with a .zip extension.
  * Use `Store` compression
* Open Kodi and go to `Settings` -> `File Manager`
* Select `Install from ZIP file`
* Locate this zip file and follow on screen prompts.
* Once installed, go to `Settings` -> `System` -> `Audio`
* In that, you'll find an option called `UI Sounds` or something similar
* Select it and choose the PlayStation 4 UI Sounds

## Note

* I don't plan to update this by adding more sounds for different actions and whatnot. I may fix it if future versions of Kodi changes something.
* Please do not request me to make new sound themes inspired from newer Xbox or PlayStation devices.
